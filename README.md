# Session 4

### Motivation
`ansible-navigator` is a textual user interface (TUI) available to Ansible Automation Platform subscribers and has been introduced with Ansible Automation Platform 2 as the primary interface for creating and testing ansible automation.

`ansible-navigator` also functions as a drop-in replacement for `ansible-playbook`, among other `ansible-*` utilities, and is the standard way of executing automation moving into Ansible Automation Platform 2.


~~~bash
python3.9 -m venv rha-navigator
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install 'ansible-navigator'
